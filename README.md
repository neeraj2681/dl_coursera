refreshing my deep learning concepts, after working with classical ml for a long time!


Did this course while exploring Stanford's CS230 - deep learning (Good idea to mix the fundamental deep learning knowledge available at Coursera with the latest advancements in the field of Deep Learning via attending the lectures for this course)

The repository is divided into 5 parts, each containing its sub-module with the slides and respective quizzes.<br>
The quizzes might be modified at bit so as to improve the learning.
